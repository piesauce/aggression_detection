Aggressive and abusive language detection


This project implements some of the key ideas presented at the [ALW2: 2nd Conference on Abusive Language Online](https://sites.google.com/view/alw2018) workshop conducted at EMNLP 2018 as well as some of my own work in this field.
The models are implemented using Keras and PyTorch, with help from NLTK and Gensim for some NLP heavylifting.

I wrote an accompanying blog post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@piesauce/what-i-learned-from-emnlp2018-papers-part-1-f7e756a1797c) that describes the interesting ideas presented at the workshop
